### **Dataset**
- **Source**: Chicago Police Department Traffic Crash Dataset  
- **Key Features**:
  - Crash type (property damage, injury, or fatality)
  - Weather and road conditions
  - Driver behavior
  - Temporal data (time of day, day of week)

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: R  
- **Tool**: RStudio  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `dplyr`, `tidyr` for data manipulation  
  - `ggplot2` for visualization  
  - `caret`, `xgboost` for machine learning  
- **Techniques**:
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Feature Engineering
  - Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
  - Machine Learning Model Development

---

### **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   Cleaned, transformed, and prepared data for analysis using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   Identified trends and correlations, visualized key patterns using `ggplot2`.
3. **Model Training**:  
   Applied and fine-tuned machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) using `caret` and `xgboost`.
4. **Evaluation**:  
   Assessed models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Results Interpretation**:  
   Derived actionable insights to guide traffic safety interventions.

### **Key Features**
- **Predictive Modeling**: Classifies crashes into severity levels with high accuracy.  
- **Insights for Policy**: Identifies high-risk scenarios for targeted interventions.  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Illustrates trends in crash data for easy understanding.  

---

### **Results**
- **Model Performance**:  
  Achieved a **20% improvement** in predictive accuracy compared to baseline models.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Weather and road conditions significantly impact crash severity.  
  - Specific time periods and locations are higher-risk zones.  
- **Impact**:  
  Recommended safety measures, including enhanced lighting and road maintenance during adverse weather.
